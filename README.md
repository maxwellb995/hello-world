# hello-world
first test project

HELLO WORLD!!! I'm familiar with the fundamentals of object oriented programming. But I'd say I'm a hobbyist trying to go deeper into the world of data science. My repositories are probably going to be projects in R, Python, & possibly some C++ related to learning & testing different supervised/unsupervised learning methods & ANN's. 

Cheers!
Max
